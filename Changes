Revision history for MPX-RIF
0.011- 2011-08-10
	rename-images.pl - has -x option to switch on actual moving versus
	just showing what would be moved.

	mpx-rif.pl: I played around with the included harvester to use less
	memory, but all attempts are in vain. I currently need around 400 MB
	of memory to harvest all MIMO records (~10k) in mpx. I didn't try
	SAX yet, but I don't see how that could help. Tried only LibXML's
	toFile versus toString + perl's string function. Very little 
	difference. I tried to be clever with perl's in-memory variables,
	but no difference either. Next I guess I would have to ask on the
	perl-xml list

0.010- 2011-08-06
	rename-images.pl - little tool to rename images which don't have
	priority (-A) in the file name.

	Changed the way the inbuilt harvester saves records. I hope this 
	saves memory. Now uses LibXML's $dom->toFile.
