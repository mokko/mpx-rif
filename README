MPX-RIF

There are many images. It takes very long to enter them manually in the
database. For each item, there are many repetitive information items, e.g. 1000
fotos were made by the same fotographer.

This little perl tool parses a directory and writes XML/MPX with the metadata.

The whole process is broken down in several consecutive steps.

State information is dumped a couple of times during executing as yaml, to
facilitate proof-reading and error checking. There are debug messages and log
messages which should help you finding quirks in your data.

The tool is pretty configurable. It's written in a haste i.e. no great code, but
should be at least readable.
